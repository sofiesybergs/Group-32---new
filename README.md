# Group-32---new

# Welcome to our project in GitHub. 

In this project we try to predict house pricing in Copenhagen, using the LASSO and RIDGE regression models. Our research question is: What impact do macroeconomics factors have on predicting apartment prices in Copenhagen?

## The data
We partly webscraped our data from Boliga.dk. We provide you with the code of the webscraping. This code is stored in the 'Web_scraping.ipynb' file. Please make sure to download Jupyter on your local computer (in combination with the Anaconda terminal). However, be aware that the practice of web scraping comes with ethical issues. If you want to run our code, please ask Boliga.dk for permission first. Also, always identify yourself.

## The code
In order to help you understand this project, we will briefly explain how our project works. Follow the following steps to get up and running:
1) Download the output.csv file and store it on your local computer. Remember the URL, as you will need it later on.
2) Open the CodeForML.ipynb file.
3) Follow the steps in the CodeForML.ipynb file.

## Overview of the files
These are the most important files in our GitHub repository:
- Newest version of the notebook is Cleaning_data.ipynb
- output.csv is the cleaned data set 
- combined.csv is the data set uploading in the notebook
- Web_scraping.ipynb is the code for the web scraping
- CodeForML.ipynb is the code for the machine learning models
